I’m a graphic designer experienced in crafting digital and print visuals — from advertising banners and Times Square billboards to websites, landing pages, and branded merchandise. I work with Photoshop, Illustrator, and Figma, integrating AI tools like MidJourney and Firefly to create bold, modern, and visually striking designs.
