      <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
      <p>Last Updated: March 15, 2025</p>
    </div>
  </section>

    <div class='container-narrow'>
      <h2>1. Overview</h2>
      <p>At Salt & Frame, we are committed to providing exceptional contemporary photography and visual branding
        services. This Refund Policy outlines the circumstances under which refunds may be granted for our services.
        This policy should be read in conjunction with our Terms & Conditions.</p>
      <p>Salt & Frame operates from Apt 12 / 45 Sandpiper Street
        Casuarina NT 0810
        Australia (ABN: 39735844). We comply
        with Australian Consumer Law, which provides protections and guarantees for consumers.</p>

      <h2>2. General Refund Principles</h2>
      <p>Due to the custom and creative nature of our photography and branding services, refunds are evaluated on a
        case-by-case basis. Our refund policy takes into account:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The stage of project completion when refund is requested</li>
        <li>The amount of work already completed</li>
        <li>Resources allocated to your project</li>
        <li>Time blocked in our schedule that could have been allocated to other clients</li>
        <li>Whether services meet the standards guaranteed under Australian Consumer Law</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Deposit Refunds</h2>
      <h3>3.1 Before Work Commences</h3>
      <p>If you request a cancellation before any work has begun on your project:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>More than 30 days before scheduled session/start date:</strong> Full refund minus 10% administration
          fee (AUD $50 minimum)</li>
        <li><strong>15-30 days before:</strong> 50% refund of deposit paid</li>
        <li><strong>Less than 15 days before:</strong> No refund; deposit is forfeited</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The administration fee covers initial consultation time, scheduling coordination, and administrative
        processing.</p>

      <h3>3.2 After Work Has Commenced</h3>
      <p>Once work on your project has begun, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Photography session conducted (even partially)</li>
        <li>Design concepts created</li>
        <li>Research or planning specific to your project</li>
        <li>Materials purchased for your project</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Deposits are non-refundable. You remain liable for the full contracted amount. We may, at our discretion, offer
        partial credit toward future services.</p>

      <h2>4. Cancellation Timeframes</h2>
      <h3>4.1 Photography Sessions</h3>
      <p>For individual photography sessions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>30+ days notice:</strong> Full refund minus 10% administration fee</li>
        <li><strong>15-30 days notice:</strong> 50% refund</li>
        <li><strong>7-14 days notice:</strong> 25% refund</li>
        <li><strong>Less than 7 days notice:</strong> No refund</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4.2 Multi-Day or Package Services</h3>
      <p>For comprehensive branding projects or multi-session packages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>30+ days before project start:</strong> Full refund minus 20% administration fee</li>
        <li><strong>15-30 days before:</strong> 40% refund</li>
        <li><strong>Less than 15 days before:</strong> No refund</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If project is partially completed, refunds are calculated based on work completed versus total project scope.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Rescheduling vs. Cancellation</h2>
      <p>We understand that circumstances change. To avoid cancellation penalties:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>First Reschedule:</strong> Complimentary if requested at least 14 days in advance</li>
        <li><strong>Additional Reschedules:</strong> AUD $150 fee per occurrence</li>
        <li><strong>Less than 7 days notice:</strong> Treated as cancellation under Section 4</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Rescheduling is subject to availability and must be completed within 6 months of original booking date.</p>

      <h2>6. Weather-Related Cancellations</h2>
      <p>For outdoor or location-based photography sessions affected by weather:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If we determine weather conditions are unsuitable, rescheduling is offered at no charge</li>
        <li>No refunds are provided for weather-related rescheduling</li>
        <li>If rescheduling is not possible within a reasonable timeframe, a full refund will be provided</li>
        <li>Client-initiated cancellations due to weather predictions follow standard cancellation terms</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Dissatisfaction with Services</h2>
      <h3>7.1 Quality Concerns</h3>
      <p>If you are dissatisfied with the quality of our work:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Notify us in writing within 7 days of receiving deliverables</li>
        <li>Provide specific details about quality concerns</li>
        <li>We will review concerns and offer corrections or re-shoots where appropriate</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Subjective preferences ("I don't like the style" or "It's not what I imagined") are not grounds for refunds if
        work was completed according to agreed specifications.</p>

      <h3>7.2 Service Failures</h3>
      <p>Refunds may be granted if we fail to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Deliver services with due care and skill</li>
        <li>Provide services fit for stated purpose</li>
        <li>Meet agreed specifications outlined in service agreement</li>
        <li>Deliver within reasonable timeframes (unless delays are client-caused)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These rights are protected under Australian Consumer Law and cannot be excluded.</p>

      <h2>8. Partial Refunds for Incomplete Projects</h2>
      <p>If a project is terminated before completion by either party:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Payment is due for all work completed to date</li>
        <li>This includes concept development, photography sessions conducted, and design work completed</li>
        <li>Work is charged at the hourly rate specified in the service agreement or AUD $200/hour if not specified</li>
        <li>Any amounts paid beyond work completed will be refunded within 14 business days</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>9. Force Majeure and Emergency Situations</h2>
      <h3>9.1 Cancellation by Salt & Frame</h3>
      <p>If we must cancel due to circumstances beyond our control, including:</p>

        <li>Natural disasters or extreme weather</li>
        <li>Government restrictions or mandates</li>

        <li>Rescheduling to a mutually convenient date</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>Reschedule without penalty, or</li>
        <li>Provide refunds exceeding standard policy where appropriate</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Documentation may be required for emergency exception requests.</p>
